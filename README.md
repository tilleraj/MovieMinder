# MovieMinder
An application to help you remember to go see movies while they're still in theaters

## Introduction
Seeing movies in theaters is a special experience, and seeing them on opening weekend is a great way to show support for your favorite
creators. Keeping up with all the movies you want to see and their release dates, or even just remembering to see them before they ride
off into the sunset can be daunting. MovieMinder was built to solve this problem, allowing users to track movies they want to watch before, during, and even after they're at the local theater.

## Technologies
MovieMinder is built with a React.js and Boostrap front-end, an ASP.NET Core back-end (including commercial WebAPI calls), and a SQL database.
